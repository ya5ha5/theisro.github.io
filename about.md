# The Indian Sonic Research Organisation

The Indian Sonic Research Organisation is a Bangalore based collective of instrument builders and artists dedicated to the proliferation of experimental music and sound art. 

We run an open community music lab in Bangalore where we build instruments,  teach, learn and collaborate through workshops, performances and artist residencies. 

Our workshops range from circuit bending, instrument building, electronics for musicians to composing with 3D sounds. 
For a complete list of workshops [click here.](/workshop.html) 

Our studio hosts the first 32 channel 3Daudio system in India.
The system is ideal for artists and composers  interested in exploring multichannel, surround sound and ambisonic sound. In addition, to this the studio is also home to a variety of quirky, rare to find instruments that range  from modular synthesisers and theremins to traditional Indian Instruments.

The 3D sound system and various instruments were built by the artists in residence at the ISRO.  The studio is free to use for members of the community and we run regular workshops for the public on sound art and studio techniques. For more information on the studio, please [click here.](/residency.html)

If you are interested in working at the ISRO studio, contributing to the workshops or are interested in using the studio for your own practice, consider applying to the artist in residence programs. We welcome instrument builders, sound artists, visual artists interested in sound, curators and ethnomusicologists and anthropologists. For a list of past residents, please click here:
