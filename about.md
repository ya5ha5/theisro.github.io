# Organisation

{:.highlight-green}

The Indian Sonic Research Organisation is a Bangalore based collective of instrument builders and artists dedicated to the proliferation of experimental music and sound art. 

We run an open community music lab in Bangalore where we build instruments,teach, learn and collaborate through workshops, performances and artist residencies. 

Our studio hosts the first 32 channel 3Daudio system in India. The studio is open to use for members of the community  and is ideal for artists and composers  interested in exploring multichannel, surround sound and ambisonic sound. The studio is also home to a variety of quirky, rare to find instruments that range from modular synthesisers and Theremins to traditional Indian Instruments. The 3D sound system and various instruments were built by the artists in residence at the ISRO. For more information on the studio, please visit this page.


# Education
The Indian Sonic Research Organisation values the sharing and dissemination of ideas through an open source model. We run workshops for adults and children that explore concepts of sound, electronics, programming and physics. We design educational kits for public distribution to emphasise the value of hands on making. Our projects and programs are fundamentally rooted in the facilitation of workshops, mentorships, apprenticeships and other educational activities.
